Extensive testing (manual) revealed the following.
There must be a delay of about 5 ms betweeen consequtive packets sent.
Time needed to process a packet may be greater than the time to receive small (1-16 byte) packet. Without delay that leads to receiving thread being blocked for too long and some bytes eventually lost.
Increasing number of packets buffered between receiving and sending threads helps to mediate the problem, but memory cost is too high.
